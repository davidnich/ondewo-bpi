### New Features

### Improvements

### Breaking Changes

* the code for generating contexts has changed:
* * this version (currently compatible with the develop version of CAI):
```python
def create_parameter_dict(my_dict: Dict) -> Optional[Dict[str, context_pb2.Context.Parameter]]:
    assert isinstance(my_dict, dict) or my_dict is None, "parameter must be a dict or None"
    if my_dict is not None:
        return {
            key: context_pb2.Context.Parameter(
                display_name=key,
                value=my_dict[key]
            )
            for key in my_dict
        }
    return None
```
* * old version (compatible with the current production CAI):
```python
from google.protobuf.struct_pb2 import Struct

def get_protobuf_struct_from_dict(my_dict: Dict) -> Struct:
    assert isinstance(my_dict, dict) or my_dict is None, "parameter must be a dict or None"
    result: Struct = Struct()
    if my_dict is not None:
        for key, value in my_dict.items():
            result[key] = value
    return result
```

### Known issues not covered in this release

* sip-client-python not open source, therefore it needs to be added seperately for external customers to use it
